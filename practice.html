          <h2>往古来今</h2>
          You promised the world and I fell for it
          I put you first and you adored it
          You set fires to my forest
          And you let it burn
          Sang off key in my chorus
          Cause it wasn’t yours
          I saw the signs and I ignored it
          Rose colored glasses all distorted
          You set fire to my purpose
          And I let it burn
          You got off on the hurtin’
          When it wasn’t yours
          We’d always go into it blindly
          I needed to lose you to find me
          This dancing was killing me softly
          I needed to hate you to love me
